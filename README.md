# Functional Programming Techniques in Kotlin

This repository is a collection of functional programming techniques implemented in
Kotlin. It is not a comprehensive catalog but rather a reference that includes techniques
I've found applicable and well-suited for expressing in code so far. It is **more like
a handbook** than a ready-to-use library of production-grade code.

The unit tests are primarily for illustrating the use of these techniques and mostly cover
single happy-path scenarios. They are **not intended for verification of correctness**.

For the best experience, view this repository in IntelliJ IDEA with "Render documentation comments" enabled in the
settings to properly format KDoc comments.
